# Project Summary

In this project we will take a look at a react application created using `create-react-app`. The layout has already been created for us but none of the functionality works. At the end of this project you should have an understanding of the following topics:

* Components
* State
* Props
* Import / Export
* .gitignore
* NPM install

After completing this project you'll have the knowledge to add more toy problems as you complete them throughout your time at DevMountain. You can also expand from toy problems if you like by adding tricks you learn during DevMountain.

## Setup

All we need to do in order to get started is run `npm install` in the root directory of the project. After `npm install` is completed you can test to see if the project is ready to go by running `npm start`. You should see in your terminal 2 warnings, however no errors. 

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step we are going to dive into the functionality of the application. If we take a look into the `src` folder we'll see that we have a `components` folder with a `TopicBrowser` and a `Topics` folder. Our `TopicBrowser` component will display a list of topics from the `Topics` folder. Each topic will be its own component. Let's start by creating our `TopicBrowser` component.
